This course taught me various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that allow computers to comprehend and work with human language. I investigated how to represent text in the first labs using techniques like word embeddings, TF-IDF, and Bag-of-Words, which convert words into numbers so that computers can process them. By lowercasing, eliminating punctuation, tokenizing, and lemmatizing words, I also worked on text preparation and cleaning. Next, I discovered how tools like NLTK and SpaCy can be used for Part-of-Speech tagging, which aids computers in determining the function of each word in a sentence. 

Lastly, I studied sentiment and emotion analysis, which allows models to identify emotions like joy or anger as well as whether a sentence is positive, negative, or neutral. I gained a better understanding of the procedures and resources required to prepare text data for machine learning and practical uses, thanks to these labs.
