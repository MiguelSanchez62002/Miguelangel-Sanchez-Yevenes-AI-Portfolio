What You’ll Learn:
Understand POS tagging fundamentals and why it matters in daily apps

Use NLTK and SpaCy for practical text analysis

Navigate different tag sets and understand their trade-offs

Handle real-world messy text like speech transcripts and social media

Apply POS tagging to solve actual business problems
