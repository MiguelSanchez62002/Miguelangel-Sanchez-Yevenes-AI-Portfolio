Text Representation Lab
In this lab, we will explore different ways to represent text in Natural Language Processing (NLP), including bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings.


# Example code
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

texts = ["I love NLP", "NLP is fun", "I love machine learning"]
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(texts)
pd.DataFrame(X.toarray(), columns=vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())


Markdown:
Bag-of-Words
The Bag-of-Words (BoW) model represents text as a vector of word counts. It ignores grammar and word order.


vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(texts)
pd.DataFrame(X.toarray(), columns=vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
